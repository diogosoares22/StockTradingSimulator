# About
<br/>

Our plataform allows users to create different models for stock trading, namely the creation of arbitrary tecniques to buy or sell a stock derived from a given understanding of the behavior of the stock's price. 
<br/>
 
After the creation of models, the user can see how the model would perform for a given period time, and for a given number of specified stocks. 
<br/>

In the traden ecosystem you can also find some very interesting mechanisms on how to combine different models, which then can be tested using backtesting techniques.
